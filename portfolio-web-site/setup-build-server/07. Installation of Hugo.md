The web site is going to be generated through the use of a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  This creates a separation of the layout of the web site from the content of the web site.  This benefit, called "separation of concern", allows for the editing of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files to update the content of the site without worrying about the layout or structure of the site.

> Note: The goal is that the build server to run headless (without a logged-in user) so the commands will be done as the root user.

1. Switch to the root user.

   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

> Note: A quick check if [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is installed is via the command `hugo version`.  This will result in an output of the current Hugo version.

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

   ```
   snap install hugo
   ```
