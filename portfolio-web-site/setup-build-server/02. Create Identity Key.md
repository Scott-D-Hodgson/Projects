The remote repository for the web site (the one created in [GitHub](https://github.com/)) is needed to be downloaded to the build server in order to be able to process the content.  The best way to do this is to configure the build server with a deploy key that will allow it to be trusted to retrieve a copy of a specific repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/) without being entrusted with the credentials of the account owner.  To setup the deploy key a utility called Secure Shell Key Generator will be used to create a private/public key combination.

> Note: The goal is that the build server to run headless (without a logged-in user) so the commands will be done as the root user.

1. Switch to the root user.

   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Change to the `.ssh` folder.

   ```
   cd ~/.ssh
   ```
   
1. Generate an identity key pair.

   > Note: Replace the `<email-address>` with the email address used for the user of the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "github-build-portfolio" -C <email-address>
   ```

   Press `<enter>` to enter an empty passphrase and again to confirm the empty passphrase.

1. View the files have been created.

   ```
   ls github-build-portfolio*
   ```

   Two files should be listed, one with an extention of `.pub` and one without.  The file with the extension is the public key while the one without is the corresponding private key.

1. Open the public key file.

   ```
   nano github-build-portfolio.pub
   ```

   Copy the contents of the file.

1. Close the public key file with `CTRL` + `x`.

1. Open (or create) the `config` file.

   ```
   nano config
   ```

1. Append to the contents of the file the following:

   ```
   #github-build-portfolio
   Host github-build-portfolio
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-build-portfolio
    ```

1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.
