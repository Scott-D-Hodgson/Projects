In preparation of the next section, installing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), what is going to be done is to first install the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package manager.

> Note: The goal is that the build server to run headless (without a logged-in user) so the commands will be done as the root user.

1. Switch to the root user.

   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

> Note: A quick check if [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) is installed is with the command `snap version` which will result in an output of the current Snap version.

1. Install the snap package manager.

   ```
   apt-get install snapd
   ```

2. Reboot the computer.

   ```
   reboot
   ```

3. Upgrade the snap package manager's core.

   ```
   snap install core
   ```
