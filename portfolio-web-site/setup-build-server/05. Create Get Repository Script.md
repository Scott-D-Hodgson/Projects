The process of building the portfolio web site will involve retrieving the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a subsequent step of building the site.  Since this process is to run on a headless server, putting it together as a script that may be called once (instead of multiple commands) helps with the automation process.

The first script required is one to retrieve the respository and ensure that it is at the most recent version.

1. Switch to the root user.

   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Change to the home folder of the `root` user.

   ```
   cd ~
   ```

1. Make a folder for scripts to be stored.

   ```
   mkdir scripts
   ```

1. Change to the `scripts` folder.

   ```
   cd scripts
   ```

1. Create a new file called `get-repo.sh`.

   ```
   touch get-repo.sh
   ```

1. Edit the `get-repo.sh` file.

   ```
   nano get-repo.sh
   ```

1. Update the contents of the script file to the following:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   while getopts k:r:f: flag
   do
     case "${flag}" in
       k) key=${OPTARG};;
       r) repo=${OPTARG};;
       f) folder=${OPTARG};;
     esac
   done
   # Build the path to where the repo will be cloned
   path=""
   IFS="/" read -r -a parts <<< "$folder"
   for index in "${!parts[@]}"
   do
     if [ "${parts[index]}" != "" ]; 
     then
       path+="/${parts[index]}"
       if [ ! -d "${path}" ]
       then
         mkdir "${path}"
       fi
     fi
   done
   # Ensure the location is empty (if it pre-existed)
   rm -rf "${path}"
   # Add the identity key to the user
   eval `/bin/ssh-agent -s`
   /bin/ssh-add "${key}"
   # Clone the repository
   echo "Cloning: ${repo} ==> ${folder}"
   git clone --recursive "${repo}" "${folder}"
   # Enter the cloned repository's folder
   cd "${folder}"
   # Ensure repository (and sub-modules) are the most recent versions
   git pull --ff-only
   git submodule update --remote
   ```
   
1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.

1. Set the permissions on the script file to allow execution.

   ```
   chmod +x get-repo.sh
   ```

1. (Optional) Test the script works to retrieve the repository.

   ```
   ./get-repo.sh -k /root/.ssh/github-build-portfolio -f /root/hugo/portfolio-source -r git@github-build-portfolio:Scott-D-Hodgson/portfolio-source.git
   ```

   Confirm the respository was downloaded into the `/root/hugo/portfolio-source` folder.
