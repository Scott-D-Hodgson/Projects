Now that the site is able to be generated, the source code should be pushed into the remote repository.  Before doing that, however, certain folders should be excluded from the push.  To inform [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which files need to be excluded (or ignored) the local repository needs to have a `.gitignore` file created.

1. Create the `.gitignore` file.

   ```
   nano .gitignore
   ```

2. Set the contents of the file to ignore the `resources` and `public` folders.

   ```
   # Hugo folders
   public
   resources

   # Hugo files
   .hugo_build.lock
   ```

1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.

## Push Files into Repository

With the site scaffolding generated, and the `.gitignore` file in place, the site structure is ready to be put (or pushed) into the repository.  The [Git](https://git-scm.com/) application will be used to prepare files for storage, taking them from being "untracked" to "staged" and "committed".

1. View the status of the files.

   ```
   git status
   ```

1. Stage all the untracked files.

   ```
   git add *
   ```

1. Stage the `.gitignore` files.

   ```
   git add .gitignore
   ```

1. Commit the files to the local repository.

   ```
   git commit -m "Add Hugo baseline"
   ```

1. Push the changes into the remote repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

   ```
   git push
   ```
