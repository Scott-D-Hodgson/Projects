The web site is going to be generated through the use of a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  This creates a separation of the layout of the web site from the content of the web site.  This benefit, called "separation of concern", allows for the editing of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files to update the content of the site without worrying about the layout or structure of the site.

> Note: A quick check if [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is installed is via the command `hugo version`.  This will result in an output of the current Hugo version.

Let's install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on the system so that the web site's scaffolding may be generated.

> Note: The following is the installation steps required for a linux system.

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

   ```
   snap install hugo
   ```
