The local repository is ready, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is ready to go, now the site scaffolding needs to be put in place into the repository's folder.

1. Navigate into the local repository folder (there should only be the `README.md` file there from when the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository was created).

1. Generate the scaffolding.

   ```
   hugo new site . --force
   ```
