Once the scaffolding for the site generator is in place a theme for the site will be required prior to generation.  Initially a default site theme will be applied (which may be updated in the future) through the useage of [GitHub](https://github.com/)'s sub-modules.  Sub-modules create a link between the current repository, and another repository, mapping the second repository to a specific location in the current one.  In this case, the remote repository is the theme that will be applied to the site and the target location is the `themes` folder.

1. Apply a theme as a sub-module.

   *Note: There are many themes available (and custom ones may be designed as well).  The sample one is called "ananke".*

   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke
   ```

   The repository will be cloned into the `theme/ananke` folder, ready for use.

1. Open the `config.toml` file in a file editor of choice.

1. Update the contents of the `config.toml` file by adding the following line to the end of the file.

   ```
   theme = 'ananke'
   ```

   The file contents should look like the following:

   ```
   baseURL = 'http://example.org'
   languageCode = 'en-us'
   title = 'My New Hugo Site'
   theme = 'ananke'
   ```

1. Save changes to the file.
