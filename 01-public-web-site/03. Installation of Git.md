The remote repository for the web site (the one created in [GitHub](https://github.com/)) is needed to be downloaded to a local repository on a workstation.  To perform this action, a utility [Git](https://git-scm.com/) will be required.  This is the command-line interface for interacting with git repositories.

*Note: Sometimes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed by default in certain Operating Systems (OS) or was previously installed.  To check if it already on the system, the command `git --version` will result in an output of the current git version.  If a version is detected, skip to the next section.*

Let's install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on the system so that the remote repository can be communicated with.

1. Log into the Ubuntu computer.

1. Add the required **apt** repositories.

   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
   ```

1. Update the **apt-get** repositories.

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
   
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

   ```
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

1. Identify personal information in the configuration for actions to be performed.

   ```
   git config --global user.name "<your name>"
   git config --global user.email "<your email address>"
   ```

1. (Optional) Set the output to be coloured.

   ```
   git config --global color.ui auto
   ```
