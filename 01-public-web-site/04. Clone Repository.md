With [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and the respository created on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a local copy of the repository can be created in order to work on the source of the web site.

*Note: The following commands don't identify where in the local machine to create the files.  Give thought towards the organization of the files on the local machine.  A recommendation is in the user's home directory as `~/dev`.*

1. Clone the web site repository using the HTTPS reference for the repository noted in the section where the repository was created.

   ```
   git clone <url>
   ```
