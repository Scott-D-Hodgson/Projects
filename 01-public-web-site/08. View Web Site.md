Finally the site is able to be viewed on the local machine!  The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) software is capable of building the site as well as running a local server to view the site in a browser.

1. Start the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Server.

   ```
   hugo server
   ```

1. Open a web broswer and navigate to http://localhost:1313 (the address/port may differ, however the actual address will be presented by the output from the `hugo server` command).
