Want to create a public web site?  Here's the steps involved with creating a public web site and, hopefully, this helps others to get their own web site setup up with minimal effort and/or headaches.

Note: This process is identical to the private web site project, with one exception:  The create repostiory page instructs the creation of the site to be in public mode.
