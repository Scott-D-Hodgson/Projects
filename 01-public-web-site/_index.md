Looking to create a public web site?  Want to store it somewhere?  Here's the guide to get the process started!

<!--more-->

The following pages will detail the steps involved with creating a public web site, utilitizing the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, and storing it into the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.  Hopefully, this helps others to get their own web site setup up with minimal effort and/or headaches.

Note: This process is identical to the private web site project, with one exception:  The create repostiory page instructs the creation of the site to be in public mode.
