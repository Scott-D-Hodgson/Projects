Prior to setting up the web site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the following prerequisites will be needed in order to get started.

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
1. Personal computer, running the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) linux operating system, and supporting peripherals to permit personal usage of the computer.  Not all are required, only what is needed for your personal setup:
   - Monitor
   - Keyboard
   - Mouse
   - Power supply

Although [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is specifically listed here, many other operating systems (OS) will also work.  This guide, however, was written in the context of using the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) OS specifically.
