The source code for the web site, to be made, will need to be stored in a safe place or, as developers say, put into a source code repository.  Most developers looking for free-to-use, source code management system will often seek to use [GitHub](https://github.com/).  This guide will be no different in that regard.

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/).

1. Click the **new respository** button to navigate to the create a repository page.

1. Enter the details of the new repository.  In the case of the hugo site, the following values are used:

   | Field | Value |
   |--|--|
   | Repository name | hugo-`<name-of-site>` |
   | Description | Source code for the `<name-of-site>` web site |
   | Add a README file | Checked

   *Note: Replace the `<name-of-site>` with the name/description of the site being generated.*

1. Click the **create repository** button.

1. With the repository created, click the **code** button to reveal the various repository Uniform Resource Location (URL) options for the repository.  Make note of them for future use.

   | Type | Example |
   |--|--|
   | HTTPS | https://github.com/`<account-name>`/hugo-`<name-of-site>`.git` |
   | SSH | git@github.com:`<account-name>`/hugo-`<name-of-site>`.git` |

   *Note: Replace the `<name-of-site>` with the name/description of the site being generated and the `<account-name>` with the name of the [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.*
