Like the guile to making a public site but want to make it private instead?  This walkthrough has you covered!

<!--more-->

The following pages will detail the steps involved with creating a private web site, utilitizing the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, and storing it into the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.  

Note: This process is identical to the public web site project, with one exception:  The create repostiory page instructs the creation of the site to be in private mode.
