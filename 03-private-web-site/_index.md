Want to create a private web site for use within your own home or business?  Here's the steps involved with creating a private web site and, hopefully, this helps others to get their own web site setup up with minimal effort and/or headaches.

Note: This process is identical to the public web site project, with one exception:  The create repostiory page instructs the creation of the site to be in private mode.
