Congratulations!  The structure of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) web site has been created and committed into the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.

At this point, the content of the site (located in the `content` folder) is able to be updated and using the command `hugo server` will start a live server that a web browser may use to view the site.

Building the site is as simple as using the command `hugo` and the resulting site's content will be published into the `public` folder.

Enjoy authoring the new site!
