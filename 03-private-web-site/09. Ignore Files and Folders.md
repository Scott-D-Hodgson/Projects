Now that the site is able to be generated, the source code should be pushed into the remote repository.  Before doing that, however, certain folders should be excluded from the push.  To inform [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which files need to be excluded (or ignored) the local repository needs to have a `.gitignore` file created.

1. Create the `.gitignore` file.

   ```
   touch .gitignore
   ```

1. Open the `.gitignore` file for editing.

1. Set the contents of the file to ignore the `resources` and `public` folders.

   ```
   # Hugo folders
   public
   resources

   # Hugo files
   .hugo_build.lock
   ```

1. Save changes to the file.
