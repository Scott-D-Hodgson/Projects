The process of building the portfolio web site will involve retrieving the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a subsequent step of building the site.  Since this process is to run on a headless server, putting it together as a script that may be called once (instead of multiple commands) helps with the automation process.

1. Create a new file called `get-repo.sh`.

   ```
   touch get-repo.sh
   ```

1. Edit the `get-repo.sh` file in the editor of choice.

1. Update the contents of the script file to the following:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   while getopts r:f: flag
   do
     case "${flag}" in
       r) repo=${OPTARG};;
       f) folder=${OPTARG};;
     esac
   done
   # Build the path to where the repo will be cloned
   path=""
   IFS="/" read -r -a parts <<< "$folder"
   for index in "${!parts[@]}"
   do
     if [ "${parts[index]}" != "" ]; 
     then
       path+="/${parts[index]}"
       if [ ! -d "${path}" ]
       then
         mkdir "${path}"
       fi
     fi
   done
   # Ensure the location is empty (if it pre-existed)
   rm -rf "${path}"
   # Clone the repository
   echo "Cloning: ${repo} ==> ${folder}"
   git clone --recursive "${repo}" "${folder}"
   # Enter the cloned repository's folder
   cd "${folder}"
   # Ensure repository (and sub-modules) are the most recent versions
   git pull --ff-only
   git submodule update --remote
   ```
   
1. Save changes to the file.

1. Set the permissions on the script file to allow execution.

   ```
   chmod +x get-repo.sh
   ```

1. (Optional) Test the script works to retrieve a repository.

   ```
   ./get-repo.sh -f <target-folder> portfolio-source -r https://github.com:<account-name>/<repository-name>.git
   ```

   *Note: Replace the `<repository-name>` with the name of the repository being retrieved, the `<account-name>` with the name of the [GitHub](https://github.com/) account holding the repository, and `<target-folder>` with the location to download and build the site.*

   Confirm the respository was downloaded into the `<target-folder>` folder.
