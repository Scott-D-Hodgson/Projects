The process of building the portfolio web site will involve generating the site's public files with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) after the repository has been retrived from [GitHub](https://github.com/).  Since this process is to run on a headless server, putting it together as a script that may be called once (instead of multiple commands) helps with the automation process.

1. Create a new file called `build-hugo.sh`.

   ```
   touch build-hugo.sh
   ```

1. Edit the `build-hugo.sh` file in the editor of choice.

1. Update the contents of the script file to the following:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   while getopts f: flag
   do
     case "${flag}" in
       f) folder=${OPTARG};;
     esac
   done
   echo "Building: ${folder}"
   cd "${folder}"
   rm -rf "${folder}/public/*"
   hugo
   ```
   
1. Save changes to the file.

1. Set the permissions on the script file to allow execution.

   ```
   chmod +x build-hugo.sh
   ```

1. (Optional) Test the scripts work to retrieve the repository and build the content.

   ```
   ./get-repo.sh -f <target-folder> portfolio-source -r https://github.com:<account-name>/<repository-name>.git
   ./build-hugo.sh -f <target-folder>
   ```

   *Note: Replace the `<repository-name>` with the name of the repository being retrieved, the `<account-name>` with the name of the [GitHub](https://github.com/) account holding the repository, and `<target-folder>` with the location to download and build the site.*

   Confirm the respository was downloaded into the `<target-folder>` folder and that the site was built into the `<target-folder>/public` folder.
