The source code for the web site, to be made, will need to be stored in a safe place or, as developers say, put into a source code repository.  Most developers looking for free-to-use, source code management system will often seek to use [GitHub](https://github.com/).  This guide will be no different in that regard.

Let's seek to create a repository there to be the home for our site.

1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Login (or, if no account exists, create a new account and login).
1. Select the new respository button to start to create a repository.
1. Enter the details of the new repository.  In the case of the portfolio site, the following values are used:

   | Field | Value |
   |--|--|
   | Repository name | portfolio-source |
   | Description | Source code for the portfolio web site |
   | Add a README file | Checked

1. Select the create repository button.
1. With the repository created, select the code button to reveal the various repository Uniform Resource Location (URL).  Make note of them for future use.

   | Type | Example |
   |--|--|
   | HTTPS | `https://github.com/Scott-D-Hodgson/portfolio-source.git` |
   | SSH | `git@github.com:Scott-D-Hodgson/portfolio-source.git` |
