The web site is going to be generated through the use of a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  This creates a separation of the layout of the web site from the content of the web site.  This benefit, called "separation of concern", allows for the editing of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files to update the content of the site without worrying about the layout or structure of the site.

> Note: A quick check if [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is installed is via the command `hugo version`.  This will result in an output of the current Hugo version.

Let's install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on the system so that the web site's scaffolding may be generated.

> Note: The following is the installation steps required for a linux system.

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

   ```
   snap install hugo
   ```

## Scaffold the Site

The local repository is ready, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is ready to go, now the site scaffolding needs to be put in place into the repository's folder.

1. Navigate into the local repository folder (there should only be the `README.md` file there from when the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository was created).
1. Generate the scaffolding.

   ```
   hugo new site . --force
   ```

The `public` folder is where the site's output will be when [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) processes all the content into the site's source files that will (eventually) be published to the web server.  Since this will be the generated result it doesn't need to be included in the official repository.  We can omit

## Apply a Theme

Once the scaffolding for the site generator is in place a theme for the site will be required prior to generation.  Initially a default site theme will be applied (which may be updated in the future) through the useage of [GitHub](https://github.com/)'s sub-modules.  Sub-modules create a link between the current repository, and another repository, mapping the second repository to a specific location in the current one.  In this case, the remote repository is the theme that will be applied to the site and the target location is the `themes` folder.

1. Apply a theme as a sub-module.

   > Note: There are many themes available (and custom ones may be designed as well).  The sample one is called `ananke`.

   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke
   ```

   The repository will be cloned into the `theme/ananke` folder, ready for use.

1. Edit the `config.toml` file.

   ```
   nano config.toml
   ```

1. Update the contents of the `config.toml` file by adding the following line to the end of the file.

   ```
   theme = 'ananke'
   ```

   The file contents should look like the following:

   ```
   baseURL = 'http://example.org'
   languageCode = 'en-us'
   title = 'My New Hugo Site'
   theme = 'ananke'
   ```

1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.

## View the Site Locally

Finally the site is able to be viewed on the local machine!  The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) software is capable of building the site as well as running a local server to view the site in a browser.

1. Start the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Server.

   ```
   hugo server
   ```

1. Open a web broswer and navigate to http://localhost:1313 (the address/port may differ, however the actual address will be presented by the output from the `hugo server` command).

## Ignore Output Folders

Now that the site is able to be generated, the source code should be pushed into the remote repository.  Before doing that, however, certain folders should be excluded from the push.  To inform [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which files need to be excluded (or ignored) the local repository needs to have a `.gitignore` file created.

1. Create the `.gitignore` file.

   ```
   nano .gitignore
   ```

2. Set the contents of the file to ignore the `resources` and `public` folders.

   ```
   # Hugo folders
   public
   resources

   # Hugo files
   .hugo_build.lock
   ```

1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.

## Push Files into Repository

With the site scaffolding generated, and the `.gitignore` file in place, the site structure is ready to be put (or pushed) into the repository.  The [Git](https://git-scm.com/) application will be used to prepare files for storage, taking them from being "untracked" to "staged" and "committed".

1. View the status of the files.

   ```
   git status
   ```

1. Stage all the untracked files.

   ```
   git add *
   ```

1. Stage the `.gitignore` files.

   ```
   git add .gitignore
   ```

1. Commit the files to the local repository.

   ```
   git commit -m "Add Hugo baseline"
   ```

1. Push the changes into the remote repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

   ```
   git push
   ```
