With the site scaffolding generated, and the `.gitignore` file in place, the site structure is ready to be put (or pushed) into the repository.  The [Git](https://git-scm.com/) application will be used to prepare files for storage, taking them from being "untracked" to "staged" and "committed".

1. View the status of the files.

   ```
   git status
   ```

1. Stage all the untracked files.

   ```
   git add *
   ```

1. Stage the `.gitignore` files.

   ```
   git add .gitignore
   ```

1. Commit the files to the local repository.

   ```
   git commit -m "Add Hugo baseline"
   ```

1. Push the changes into the remote repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

   ```
   git push
   ```
