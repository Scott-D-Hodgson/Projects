The process of building the portfolio web site will involve generating the site's public files with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) after the repository has been retrived from [GitHub](https://github.com/).  Since this process is to run on a headless server, putting it together as a script that may be called once (instead of multiple commands) helps with the automation process.

1. Switch to the root user.

   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Change to the home folder of the `root` user.

   ```
   cd ~
   ```

1. Change to the `scripts` folder.

   ```
   cd scripts
   ```

1. Create a new file called `build-hugo.sh`.

   ```
   touch build-hugo.sh
   ```

1. Edit the `build-hugo.sh` file.

   ```
   nano build-hugo.sh
   ```

1. Update the contents of the script file to the following:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   while getopts f: flag
   do
     case "${flag}" in
       f) folder=${OPTARG};;
     esac
   done
   echo "Building: ${folder}"
   cd "${folder}"
   rm -rf "${folder}/public/*"
   hugo
   ```
   
1. Save changes to the file by pressing `CTRL` + `x`, typing `y` in response to saving the "modified buffer", and pressing the `enter` key to preserve the same filename.

1. Set the permissions on the script file to allow execution.

   ```
   chmod +x build-hugo.sh
   ```

1. (Optional) Test the scripts work to retrieve the repository and build the content.

   ```
   ./get-repo.sh -k /root/.ssh/github-build-portfolio -f /root/hugo/portfolio-source -r git@github-build-portfolio:Scott-D-Hodgson/portfolio-source.git
   ./build-hugo.sh -f /root/hugo/portfolio-source
   ```

   Confirm the respository was downloaded into the `/root/hugo/portfolio-source` folder and that the site was built in the `/root/hugo/portfolio-source/public` folder.
